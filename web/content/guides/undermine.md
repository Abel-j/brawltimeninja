Recommended Comp
---

Note: Deathcap Cave has a lot of diverse comps and this one is just a suggestion.

---

### Pam

<media-img path="/brawlers/pam/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Mid player who offers a lot of area control. She has a good healing spot and can also assist her lane players with it.

### Nita

<media-img path="/brawlers/nita/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Left lane player that can utilize the walls to poke enemies. Her overall tankiness allows her to poke and fall back, while her bear can annoy mid.

### Leon

<media-img path="/brawlers/leon/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Right lane player that can poke and burst down enemies. There are many bushes which makes it easy for him to assasinate enemies.

Alternate Comps
---

### Alternative to Pam

<media-img path="/brawlers/gene/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

<media-img path="/brawlers/jessie/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Gene can poke at the enemy's mid while his super can easily turn the game around. If he pushes up he can also dish out alot of damage.
Jessie's tankiness and medium-long range attack makes her a great mid playre. She also has good turret spots.

### Alternative to Nita

<media-img path="/brawlers/frank/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

<media-img path="/brawlers/spike/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Frank's presence and powerful attack can keep enemies back. He effectively controls an entire area by simply "being there".
Spike can clear his lane pretty effetcively and pressure mid from there. His super also denies chokepoints well.

### Alternative to Leon

<media-img path="/brawlers/gene/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

<media-img path="/brawlers/carl/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Gene also can work as a lane player. His spread attack makes it hard for the enemy's lane to push up. He can also poke at mid when he is pushed up.
Carl can deny mid entryway if he manages to win his lane.

Initial Setup
---

Nita can push up to the north-west of the mine to harass mid.

Pam should focus her attacks to the north of the mine. She should not be worrying about clearing out lanes given that her teammates win their fights.
If both teammates win their lane, the enemy's mid will be forced to fall back. Pam should take this opportunity to push up and help spawntrap for a bit.

Leon needs to apply pressure if the enemy stops contesting the east lane. This will usually be the case as it's hard to kill him once he gets control of this area.

The main healing spot if the enemy's mid is not Jessie or Penny is the bush south to the mine. It covers more area and even though it's exposed it will be tanked for by Pam. If the enemy has Jessie or Penny as mid, place it below the wall.

Nita will initially be playing in the west lane and she should fall back there to regenerate.

---

Generally speaking, one lane will usually be lost. Pam needs to play around this by falling to the opposite lane and helping that lane win. She can then return to mid but should also clear that lane out occasionally. Capitalize on fights you win and push enemies back. Once both lanes are yours it becomes very hard for the enemy to regain mid. Don't let this happen to you!

**When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.**
