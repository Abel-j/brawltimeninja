<media-img path="/brawlers/nita/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-10 float-right p-1"></media-img>

Leon can poke at enemies and burst enemies down at close ranges. His super can easilyy change the game as there are so many bushes to utilize.
Nita can poke at mid while keeping control of her lane easily. Her bear pushes back enemies as well.

Initial Setup
---

If the enemy falls back, Shelly can position herself to the north-east of the mine to poke at them where the maximum range of Gene's super is. However, she sohuld fall back to keep moderate amounts of HP.

If Carl is able to push up with Shelly, it'll make it extremely hard for the enemy to get out of spawn. He can easily hold his lane while pressuring mid. He can push up to apply pressure when Gene has his super.

Shelly can use the jump pad on the east to quickly rotate into an advantageous position if the enemy is badly positioned. She needs to recognize when this is necessary as she can be punished easily for doing so!

Shelly needs to make sure an enemy tank does not jump below the mine. If one does, it'll force Gene back and potentially get him killed. Good communication is necessary.

Gene can assist either lane by positioning himself in mid. However, he should focus on staying alive with minimal amounts of damage taken.

**When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.**
