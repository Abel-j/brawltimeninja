name: frank
main: After half a second, Frank starts his first main attack. Standing still, the following attacks execute faster. His attack can hit multiple targets at once so he can deal a lot of damage to Brawlers standing in a group.
super: The stun from his super is ideal to lock enemies in place before using his main attack. You can use the super to remove walls and gain a permanent advantage on the map.
