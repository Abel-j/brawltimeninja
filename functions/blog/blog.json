He is also a great counter to turrets, which will be found in this map’s meta. His Star Power allows him to stay alive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"alternate-comps\">Alternate Comps</h2>\n<h3 id=\"alternative-to-pam\">Alternative to Pam</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/jessie_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/jessie_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/bo_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/bo_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p>Jessie’s tankiness and medium-long range attack makes her a great mid player. She also has good turret spots. Bo can mine off a choke point and use his arrows to cut off another. There are two main choke points on this map.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alternative-to-nita\">Alternative to Nita</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/frank_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/frank_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/shelly_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/shelly_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p>Frank’s presence and powerful attack can keep enemies back. He effectively controls an entire area by simply “being there”. Shelly pushed up can hold enemies away because of her powerful super.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alternative-to-barley\">Alternative to Barley</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/dynamike_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/dynamike_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/mortis_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/mortis_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/hero/icon/gene_optimized.png\" alt=\"hero/icon/gene_optimized.png\" class=\"h-10 p-1 float-right\"></p>\n<p>Dynamike offers more destruction and damage over Barley’s sustained control of the map. Mortis has a lot of cover he can utilize, and can counter throwers and punish weak, grouped up enemies. Gene can help mid with his Star Power and wide attack. His super can also turn the game around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-setup\">Initial Setup</h2>\n<p>Barley should control the areas top of the mine. With his Star Power, he can keep up constant pressure even while on low health.</p>\n<p>If the enemy falls back, Pam shoud push up to apply as much pressure with her healing and fall back when at medium to low HP.</p>\n<p>Nita’s strongest position is on the left. She can fully utilize the wall to control the chockepoint and make it hard for the enemy to push her.</p>\n<p>Nita will initially be on the wall south-east to the mine. She should be there when she is low but should try to push up into her strongest position.</p>\n<p>North to the mine is the main area where Pam should focus her attacks. Barley is responsibe for the other chokepoints. Her spread out atatck can deter squishies from pushing up.</p>\n<p>South to the mine behind the wall is the main healing station spot. It helps Pam stay alive at high amounts of HP.</p>\n<p>South-east tot the mine is the healing spot if Barley is pushed back or the right lane is lost. Pam should also be positioned there if this happens.</p>\n<p>Barley should try to regain control of the area south-east to the mine if an enemy has put themselves there!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"graphic\">Graphic</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/guides/deathcap-cave.jpg\" alt=\"blog/guides/deathcap-cave.jpg\" class=\"lightbox\"></p>\n<p>Click to enlarge</p>\n"

This is where the enemy will attack mid from.</p>\n<p>Destroying the walls north to the mine will work both ways. It’ll make mid much more open therefore harder for Frank to hold.</p>\n<p>Rico needs to shoot down the lane at thea east to clear out any potential threats. It’s important to hold at least one lane so mid does not get completely flanked.</p>\n<p>Rico and Carl can clear out enemies hiding in the corners on the side of the mine.</p>\n<p>Carl needs to shoot down the east lane to clear out any potential threats. It’s important to hold at leas one lane so mid does not get completely flanked.</p>\n<p>It’s important that mid is never flanked. If a lane is lost, mid must be extremely careful of the area south of the mine. A good flank by the enemy can turn the entire game around!</p>\n<p>Sometimes the enemy will “double up” on mid. This means that one lane will be free. The free lane player should either help with their attacks from the side, or go and flank mid from behind.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"graphic\">Graphic</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/guides/stone-fort.jpg\" alt=\"blog/guides/stone-fort.jpg\" class=\"lightbox\"></p>\n<p>Click to enlarge</p>\n"

His spread attack makes it hard for the enemy’s lane to push up. He can also poke at mid when he is pushed up.<br>Carl can deny mid entryway if he manages to win his lane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-setup\">Initial Setup</h2>\n<p>Nita can push up to the north-west of the mine to harass mid.</p>\n<p>Pam should focus her attacks to the north of the mine. She should not be worrying about clearing out lanes given that her teammates win their fights.<br>If both teammates win their lane, the enemy’s mid will be forced to fall back. Pam should take this opportunity to push up and help spawntrap for a bit.</p>\n<p>Leon needs to apply pressure if the enemy stops contesting the east lane. This will usually be the case as it’s hard to kill him once he gets control of this area.</p>\n<p>The main healing spot if the enemy’s mid is not Jessie or Penny is the bush south to the mine. It covers more area and even though it’s exposed it will be tanked for by Pam. If the enemy has Jessie or Penny as mid, place it below the wall.</p>\n<p>Nita will initially be playing in the west lane and she should fall back there to regenerate.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Generally speaking, one lane will usually be lost. Pam needs to play around this by falling to the opposite lane and helping that lane win. She can then return to mid but should also clear that lane out occasionally. Capitalize on fights you win and push enemies back. Once both lanes are yours it becomes very hard for the enemy to regain mid. Don’t let this happen to you!</p>\n<p><strong>When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"graphic\">Graphic</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/guides/undermine.jpg\" alt=\"blog/guides/undermine.jpg\" class=\"lightbox\"></p>\n<p>Click to enlarge</p>\n"
