Recommended Comp

### Piper

<media-img path="/brawlers/piper/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Mid player whose long range can easily make her come out on top in fights. Her super allows her to make clutch plays coupled with minecarts.

### Carl

<media-img path="/brawlers/carl/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Mid player whose attack can cut off rotations. He also can take some damage while applying pressure.

### Barley

<media-img path="/brawlers/barley/avatar" size="96" clazz="h-16 float-right p-2"></media-img>

Mid player who offers a lot of control because of how the minecarts will funnel enemy movement.

Alternate Comps

### Alternative to Piper

<media-img path="/brawlers/bo/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-12 float-right p-1"></media-img>

<media-img path="/brawlers/gene/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-12 float-right p-1"></media-img>

Bo's mines make it harder for the enemy to safely push up. It synergizes well with minecarts.
Gene can fully utilize the minecarts to easily pull and punish enemies who are forced to move in an odd way.

### Alternative to Carl

<media-img path="/brawlers/gene/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-12 float-right p-1"></media-img>

Gene can fully utilize the minecarts to easily pull and punish enemies who are forced to move in an odd way.

### Alternative to Barley

<media-img path="/brawlers/dynamike/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-12 float-right p-1"></media-img>

<media-img path="/brawlers/mortis/avatar" size="60" clazz="h-12 float-right p-1"></media-img>

Dynamike offers more map destruction than Barley and can also deal more damage when utilizing minecarts.
Mortis can counter throwers while being able to harass the enemy from behind.

Initial Setup
---

Minecarts that come from the north make it impossible for the enemy to fall back for ~2 seconds, while providing cover if they are already in the process of doing so. Learning how to use this to your advantage will make it easy for you to win.

There will often be enemies trapped in the bush nort-east of the mine, when the minecart comes from the west side. You can easily deal huge amounts of damage to them as Barley.

At the east side minecart spawn, the minecarts will travel to your side which means you have some time to make a decision whether to push up or fall back.

Minecarts that come to the south of the mine make it impossible for your team to fall back for ~2 seconds. It's important to recognize when you should. If you have a lot of HP remaining, you can keep fighting at mid. Barley can utilize the brief moment when the minecarts block off the center to prevent the enemy team from pushing up. If Piper is low, she should fall back, she won't be able to survive for the 2 seconds her back is blocked off.

At the west side minecart spawn, the minecarts will travel to the enemy's side so making an offensive push is necessary. It's important, however, that you can safely fall back after they are gone.

---

The more you play this map, the better you will get with recognizing opportunities the minecarts provide you. The thrower needs to capitalize the most when the minecarts start coming.

**When a teammate dies, reposition to try to hold as much map presence for as long as possible.**
