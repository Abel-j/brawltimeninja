In an ecosystem, certain species are referred to as keystone species, species whose presence makes a profound and, often times, disproportionate impact on the ecology of that biosphere. Examples include the elephant in southern Africa and wolves in Yellowstone. These animals impact almost every aspect of the ecosystem, like keeping a particular species from overtaking and ruining the fine balance of the ecosystem.

This concept can be applied to Brawl Stars: Brawlers who warp the meta so much that without them, the competitive meta would be far more alien.

Of course, this concept has a certain change to it. Keystone Brawlers cycle through the metas due to the balancing, but even at their weakest, they impact the meta to some degree.

An example is Mr. P, who when meta causes sharpshooters to be weaker, and tanks to be a lot better. Once he got nerfed, sharpshooters were a lot better.

Another example is Gene, a Brawler so dominant that every meta he's been in, he's affected the meta Brawlers. Once he got nerfed, Brawlers that relied on him like Max and Spike got a lot worse despite no direct nerfs.

Poco is another great example. If he is meta, tanks are meta too, which makes assassins and sharpshooters bad, but dedicated tank killers great as well.

The difference between a keystone and a Brawler that is overpowered is that the overpowered Brawler temporarily affects the meta only when he's strong, while the keystone affects the meta whatever its viability is.

For example, at the time of writing, Colt is an overpowered brawler, but his kit doesn't directly impact other Brawlers. Byron changes viabilities of brawlers. Keystones' kits impact brawlers directly and change the meta a lot.

What's the importance of keystones? I think you could predict metas and compositions easily, as well as work out how Brawlers should be balanced, basically a lot of theorising work could be done with more exploration of this topic.

The keystones I think everyone can agree on are Mr. P, Gene, Colette, Poco and Tara, with more disputed brawlers being Carl, Byron, Mortis and Pam. All have made many impacts on the meta, and have shifted many of the brawlers' viabilities.
